logic , a way to do things reasoningly.

```
predicate E, E= x<y and (A i: 0<=i<n:b[i]<y)
```

if logic is similar to E,
your decision including computation, is to judge what is better between two things or stronger,or more beautiful.

<!--more-->

Thinking about the logic.'better','stronger','faster'???

All the result will recursively become true and false, rather than one value.

Your brain will think out the solution to give you the right direction(or you never think about it,
all your walking direction is move ahead with the others' help), and keep going on.

So why logic finally carry out? To get a more beautiful and elegant way to live. To save your money and energy.
To get a faster method to carry out your computation.

Maybe,we can look Mr logic as your brain replacer, he will get you right and wrong(but if your replacer is wrong or
logic chaos,maybe you will feel confused). Yeah, from mathematic logic, we can look logic as the organisation of the 
predicates. All logic will return to the process of predicate transform.

Noted.
