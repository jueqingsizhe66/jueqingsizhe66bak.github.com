why need perl? If you need strong text regex processing ,use perl!

One paragraph I copied from `perldoc perlintro`:

The language is intended to be <font color="red">practical</font> (easy to use, efficient,
complete) rather than beautiful (tiny, elegant, minimal). Its major
features are that it's easy to use, supports both procedural and
object-oriented (OO) programming, has powerful built-in support for text
processing, and has one of the world's most impressive collections of
third-party modules.

To me, perl means a report programmer with practical experience.
