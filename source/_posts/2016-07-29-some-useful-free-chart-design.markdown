chart can make the data more beautiful, a good tool  to make chart is very important. 

Without java compile programming language, then we can go to [Microsoftstore][5] to purchase Excel to
manage your data and visulize them; Or we can buy the [originLab][6] to do the 2D line chart and the [tecplot][7]
to draw the 3D contour and pathline picture. What's more. a open source software [Gnuplot][8],which is more 
stronger than the [Originlab][6].

With java compile programming language, which tool we should choose?

Below are some suggestions.

<!--more-->

1. [Jfreechart][3], a very powerful java source chart platform.
2. [Echart3][2], the Baidu Opensource software, which is written by  the javascript, also very beautiful.
3. [R3-Query][1], maybe good.
4. [fineReport][4], not free.
